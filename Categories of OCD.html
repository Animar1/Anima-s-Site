        <ins>Ocd is defined in classes and subtypes.
        </ins> Many people think there's a certain way to do something right in their own way though. When it comes to books, pencils, pens, rulers, books etc, those with ocd tend to have a problem with aligning. They'll like to have all materials in a certain order or aligned a certain way. Uncontrolled hand washing is another problem too. Some may feel the need to wash hands over and over. It's not the thought of doing it correctly, but the fear of having contamination. They might think they will harm others even theirself by catching an illness or something.
