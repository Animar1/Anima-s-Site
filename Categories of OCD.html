        <ins>Ocd is defined in classes and subtypes.
        </ins> Many people think there's a certain way to do things right in their own way though. When it comes to books, pencils, pens, rulers, books etc, those with OCD have a problem with aligning. For instance, they'll like to have all materials in a certain order like colorwise. Uncontrolled hand washing is another problem people come across. Some may feel the need to wash hands over and over. It's not the thought of doing it correctly, but the fear of having contamination. They might think they will harm others even theirself by catching an illness or something.
