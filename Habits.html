We all have habits with daily routines in our lives, but people with OCD struggle with more. When people hesr of ocd the common thing they would know is orgaizing, but its not just that. when ocd people organize it affects their daily routine, min things they would focus on is  How to walk, thinking on how to say something, what/how to eat, organizing clothes showering. With their thinking they think have to do things a certain way. Their thoughts are what leads them to react the way they react. The more they are used to those routines the more it'll be a habit that can be hard to break.When they don't listen to their thoughts, they can feel like they are doing something wrong which leads to stress and breakdowns. For example, with the hand washing, they would wash hands because of the fear of contamination. You would check lock over and over again, same with phone, tapping wall to reduce  the anxiety, counting all day long, spending too much time cleaning repeselty,  having bad thoughts worrying about health etc.
