    We all have habits with daily routines in our lives, but people with OCD struggle with more. When people hear of the
    word OCD, the common thing people will think of is organizing, but its not just that. When OCD people organize, it
    affects their daily routine. Main things they would focus on is how to walk, thinking on how to say something,
    what/how to eat, organizing clothes, showering and so on. With their thinking, they think have to do things a
    certain way. Their thoughts are what leads them to react the way they react. The more they are used to those
    routines, the more it'll be a habit that can be hard to break. When they don't listen to their thoughts, they can
    feel like they are doing something wrong which leads to stress and breakdowns. For example, with the hand washing,
    they would wash hands because of the fear of contamination. You would check lock over and over again, same with
    phones like making sure you accidently didn't post on your story, tapping walls just to help anxiety, counting all
    day long, spending too much time cleaning having bad thoughts worrying about their health and so on. These all are
    repeated in their life.
