    As much as one has the unwanted thoughts that their brain controls them to do, they cant stop. Long term affects can kead to depresion, constant axiety and and incresed risk of substance abuse. Overtime, the effects increases. Some symptoms can decrsase and increse/go away and come back overtime. OCD truly never goes away. There isnt a cure to it other than therapy and medications.
