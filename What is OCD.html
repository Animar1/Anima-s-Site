    OCD gives one the  urge of towards odering and perfectionilsm. This is from the ideas or sensations one comes up with from thoughts. It's a mental disorder which means all the actions come from the thinking one has. OCD can be from gentic and hedirditary factors. Anxiety, or one going through a traumamtic event can be a trigger too. 94% of the population suffers from this. Strepoctal infection which causes other throat infections is another cause too but unlike the other factors, it's rare.
